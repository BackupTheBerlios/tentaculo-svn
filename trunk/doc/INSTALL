The installation steps are:

* Uncompress the .tar.gz

* Move the 'tentaculo' directory to the DocumentRoot in your apache web server.
  The files in the 'log' directory must be writable by the user running the 
  webserver. Change the group that own the files by the webserver group and give 
  write privileges to it (You need root privileges to execute these operations.):
  
  # chgrp www-data log/*; chmod g+w log/*

  www-data is the default webserver groupname in Debian, the groupname depends on
  each distribution.

* Copy the contents of the misc/apache.conf in the apache configuration file. 
  The file is based on Debian defaults. Change /var/www to your DocumentRoot.
  You can add an 'Include /path/to/tentaculo/misc/apache.conf' line in the apache
  configuration file too. You can also copy the apache.conf file as tentaculo.conf 
  in the /etc/apache/conf.d/ directory.

* Import the default database from misc/tentaculo.sql into a mysql 4.0 server and 
  create an account with all data privileges (Select, Insert, Update and Delete) 
  in this database. Change the access data (username and password) in lib/DBIBase.pm

* Point your browser to http://server/tentaculo . The default username and password
  are 'admin' and 'hola' respectivly.
