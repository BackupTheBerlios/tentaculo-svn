The installation steps are:

* Uncompress the .tar.gz

* Move the navcon directory to the DocumentRoot in your apache web server

* Copy the contents of the misc/apache.conf in the apache configuration file. 
  The file is based on Debian defaults. Change /var/www to your DocumentRoot.
  You can add an Include /path/to/navcon/misc/apache.conf line in the apache
  configuration file too

* Create the directory /var/log/nc and the files messages and errors into it 
  with permissions 660 owned by root:'apache-group'. The debian default values
  are root:www-data

* Import the default database from misc/tentaculo.sql into a mysql 4.0 server and 
  create an account with all data privileges (Select, Insert, Update and Delete) 
  in this database. Change the access data (username and password) in lib/DBIBase.pm
